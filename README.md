## Students who only registered for Statistics II 
Students who are taking Statistics II are assumed to have knowledge in the contents covered in Statistics I and basic R skills. Those registered only for Statistics II are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to AUDIT (go through all the videos and R lab session materials) Statistics I as the contents covered in the first statistics sequence (Statistics I) have been changed from the contents from the past years. (If you took the Statistics I class taught by me (Sohn) last year, you do not have to.) Please send an email to ysohn.teaching@gmail.com with your student number. 

## Students must install R and RStudio programs on their own computers.

1. Install R (choose one of the websites located close to your area of acccess: https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)
 - **Download and Install R** for your operating system.
2. Install RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
	- Download and install the one for your operating system under **All Installers**.
