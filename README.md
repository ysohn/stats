## Students who only registered for Statistics II 
Students who are taking Statistics II are assumed to have knowledge in the contents covered in Statistics I and basic R skills. You can freely access Statistics I materials on this website. However, those registered only for Statistics II are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to AUDIT (go through all the videos and R lab session materials) Statistics I as the contents covered in the first statistics sequence (Statistics I) have been changed from the contents from the past years.
