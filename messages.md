Welcome to Statistics I (and II)!

I would like to announce a few things regarding the logistics of the class.

0. Students who only registered for Statistics II 
	- Students who are taking Statistics II are assumed to have knowledge in the contents covered in Statistics I and basic R skills. Those registered only for Statistics II are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to AUDIT Statistics I (go through all the lecture and R lab session materials at https://github.com/ysohn/stats) as the contents covered in the first statistics sequence (Statistics I) have been changed from the contents from the past years. If you took the Statistics I class taught by me (Sohn) last year, you do not have to. 

1. I plan to update all class-related information at https://github.com/ysohn/stats 
	- Please visit the website frequently.  
	- Notification messages will be posted at this website as well.

2. Your TA is Masanori Kikuchi who is a graduate student in political science and a recent graduate of SPSE BA program. 
	- Please direct all R and RStudio related questions to his email address: [waseda.statistics@gmail.com](mailto:waseda.statistics@gmail.com)
	- You may ask him about lecture related questions as well, but you can also reach the instructor (ysohn.teaching@gmail.com) if you watn to get further information. 

3. Evaluation: This is a P/Q (pass/fail) class. Your performance in this class will be evalulated by weekly quiz sets and a simple R code problem set given at the end of the quarter. I do not intend to fail anyone who complete the class materials. Don't be stressed!
	- The first set of quizzes will be relased on the second week. Details will be announced around the release. 
	- For logistical concerns (e.g. gpa calculation), please consult with the school office as instructors do not have accurate information.

4. Lecture/Lab class video upload: 
	- I am doing my best to find out the best technology.  
	- The files will be uploaded to either the Moodle class page or [this webpage](https://github.com/ysohn/stats). I will post an announcement when I upload the first week materials.  
	- Each weekly materials will be uploaded by the following time every week: 
		- Lecture slides/videos: every Monday by 4:30 PM  
		- Lab materials/videos: every Tuesday by 4:30 PM

5. [IMPORTANT] What you **must** do before taking the lab class. 
	- Install R (choose one of the websites located close to your area of acccess: https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)
		- **Download and Install R** for your operating system.
	- Install RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
		- Download and install the one for your operating system under **All Installers**.
	- Please ask the TA [waseda.statistics@gmail.com](mailto:waseda.statistics@gmail.com) if you have concerns when installing.
