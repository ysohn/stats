This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple syntax for generating reports in HTML, PDF, and MS Word formats.

To italicize text you just write use *single asterisks* while to bold-face text you use **double asterisks**.

```{r}

# loading the R data set
# load("C:/Folder/States.RData")

# examining the data set
head(States)
nrow(States)
ncol(States)

```

When you click the "Knit" button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.
